# Neural Network

## Introduction

I made my own version of neural network based on the videos of "The Coding Train."
This neural network has 1 input layer, 1 output layer and can have n hidden layers.
This neural network can use either a user provided cctivation function, the default
activation function (tanh) or the user can select from the list of activation functions
provided in io.github.NavjotSRakhra.neuralnetwork.activation package.

## Project setup

This project is made using OpenJDK 20. To install the project into your maven repository,
execute `mvn clean install` in `.\NeuralNetwork\`.
